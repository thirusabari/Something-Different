# Something-Different
This Repository having Simple Projects for Beginners. The Projects ideas may be new one or existing ideas. Each Project folder having a word document which describes about the project/technologies used inside it. 

# Note
Here I didn't followed any standards for the development. Just Implemented the Idea without Base Knowledge. 

# First Project - CRUD:
   The Idea Behind CRUD is like a "Management System". Here I have Implemented the "ID Card Design Management System". This application will holds the data of existing sample ID Card Designs and Base Informations. And also you can able to Provide new data about Your perspectives for a Id Card. A Sample Template will  be create for retreiving data from the Customers and will be Implement Shortly. 
   
# Second Project - Verb Filter:
   Nowadays, Learning of English Seems Easy. Because Lot of Educational Centres, Free Online Courses, Free Lancer Tutors are there for us to teach the Language. But how about the tenses. As We know, word "verb" is the heart of the sentence.  Before making a sentence, we should be clear on "Verbal action going to used". For the Beginners learning of new verbs related to their work/ departments/ fields was little bit hard. To overcome this, have introducing the concept called ,"Verb Filter". In this Application, no User Credentials Required. Just run the application and search a word in the text box. Then the result will contains a table with "Past Tense, Present Tense and Future Tense/Past Participle" as Headers/Rows. And also, if you don't know any verb, not a problem. we will provide some categories for the general Information's like Education/work/Medical/Laws/Spiritual/etc,.. But we were limited the verbs displayed under the categories. And This Application might be more useful for the learners who are all in the Beginning stage of Spoken English.
