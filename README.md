# Something-Different
This Repository having Simple Projects for Beginners. The Projects ideas may be new one or existing ideas. Each Project folder having a word document which describes about the project/technologies used inside it. 

# Note
Here I didn't followed any standards for the development. Just Implemented the Idea without Base Knowledge. 

# First Project - CRUD:
   The Idea Behind CRUD is like a "Management System". Here I have Implemented the "ID Card Design Management System". This application will holds the data of existing sample ID Card Designs and Base Informations. And also you can able to Provide new data about Your perspectives for a Id Card. A Sample Template will  be create for retreiving data from the Customers and will be Implement Shortly. 
   
# Why we need ID Card Design Management System ?
   Nowadays, People we are all Digitalized. If we request a design from a studio/ shop they have to search the existing designs for display the sample for us. Instead of searching through all folders, if we put all those data inside application with a standardized template, and it will useful for us easily categorized the samples. That's the thing, I have injecting this idea with the CRUD Application.
