# Something-Different
This Repository having Simple Projects for Beginners. The Projects ideas may be new one or existing ideas. Each Project folder having a word document which describes about the project/technologies used inside it. 

# Note
Here I didn't followed any standards for the development. Just Implemented the Idea without Base Knowledge. 

# First Project - CRUD:
   The Idea Behind CRUD is like a "Management System". Here I have Implemented the "ID Card Design Management System". This application will holds the data of existing sample ID Card Designs and Base Informations. And also you can able to Provide new data about Your perspectives for a Id Card. A Sample Template will  be create for retreiving data from the Customers and will be Implement Shortly. 
   
# Why we need ID Card Design Management System ?
  If we request a ID Card Design from a Design Shop/Photo Studio normally it takes some number of days to complete the Process. If a customer running out  of deadline, on that time he has to pay more money to the shop for the last minute Design works. 
Sometimes, customers requirement was rejected my the client(shops) due to lack of time/Employees. Sometimes Employees has to work for the late night for Last Minute Design works . To Overcome this, Introducing a Application here. It will having the existing ID Card Samples Information’s and Templates as PSD Files/ Images. And We can able to Create ID Card Designs by the Templates Provided in the Application.  

# Second Project - Verb Filter:
   Nowdays, Learning of English Seems Easy. Because Lot of Educational Centers, Free Online Courses, Free Lancer Tutors are there for us to teach the Language. But how about the tenses. As We know, word "verb" is the heart of the sentence.  Before making a sentence, we should be clear on "Verbal action going to used". For the Beginners learning of new verbs related to their work/ departments/ fields was little bit hard. To overcome this, have introducing the concept called ,"Verb Filter". In this Application, no User Credentials Required. Just run the application and search a word in the text box. Then the result will contains a table with "Past Tense, Present Tense and Future Tense/Past Participle" as Headers/Rows. And also, if you don't know any verb, not a problem. we will provide some categories for the general Informations like Education/work/Medical/Laws/Spriritual/etc,.. But we were limited the verbs displayed under the categories. And This Application might be more useful for the learners who are all in the Beginning stage of spoken english.
